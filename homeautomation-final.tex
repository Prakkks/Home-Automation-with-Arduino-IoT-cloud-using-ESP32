	\subsection{PIR Sensor}
	\begin{justify}
		A PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor is a motion detection device that detects changes in infrared radiation emitted by objects within its field of view. It consists of a pyroelectric sensor, which is sensitive to infrared radiation, and a lens that focuses the infrared signals onto the sensor. PIR sensors work based on the principle that all objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit infrared radiation. When a person or an object moves in front of the sensor, the changes in the infrared radiation patterns are detected by the pyroelectric sensor, triggering an electrical signal. PIR sensors are commonly used in security systems, automatic lighting systems, and smart home devices to detect human presence and movement. Due to their passive nature they do not emit any radiation themselves.

	\subsection{RFID Sensor}
	\begin{justify}
		An RFID  sensor is a technology that allows for the identification and tracking of objects or individuals using radio frequency signals. The RFID system consists of two main components: an RFID tag and an RFID reader or sensor. The RFID tag contains a unique identification code and an antenna, while the RFID reader emits radio frequency signals to communicate with the tag. When the RFID reader comes within range of the RFID tag, the tag's antenna captures the radio frequency signal, and it responds by transmitting its unique code back to the reader. The RFID sensor then decodes and processes this information, enabling the identification of the tagged object or person. RFID sensors are widely used in various applications, such as inventory management, access control systems, asset tracking, contactless payment systems, and electronic toll collection.

	\subsection{LDR}
	
	\begin{justify}
		An LDR , also known as a photoresistor, is a type of semiconductor device that exhibits changes in its electrical resistance based on the intensity of light falling on it. The LDR is typically made of a high-resistance semiconductor material that becomes conductive when exposed to light. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of the LDR decreases, and vice versa. This unique property makes LDRs highly suitable for light sensing applications. In electronic circuits, LDRs are commonly used as sensors to detect ambient light levels, enabling automatic control of lighting systems. For example, LDRs can be employed in streetlights, indoor lamps, and camera exposure control, where they adjust the intensity of light output based on the surrounding light conditions. The sensitivity of LDRs can be fine-tuned by varying their physical properties or using additional circuitry.

	\begin{justify}A water level sensor is a device used to measure and monitor the depth of water in a tank, reservoir, or any other container. It provides valuable information about the water level, ensuring efficient water management and preventing overflows or shortages.The power and sense traces form a variable resistor (much like a potentiometer) whose resistance varies based on how much they are exposed to water.This resistance varies inversely with the depth of immersion of the sensor in water:The more water the sensor is immersed in, the better the conductivity and the lower the resistance.The less water the sensor is immersed in, the poorer the conductivity and the higher the resistance.

	\subsection{MQ2 Gas Sensor }
	\begin{justify}
		The MQ2 gas sensor is a widely used semiconductor-based sensor designed to detect various combustible gases and smoke in the surrounding environment. It operates on the principle of gas absorption, where the presence of specific gases alters the sensor's conductivity, resulting in a change in its resistance. The MQ2 sensor is equipped with a heating element that increases the temperature of its sensitive layer. When the target gas or smoke comes into contact with the heated layer, the sensor's resistance changes, and this variation is measured to determine the gas concentration. It can detect gases like methane, butane, propane, alcohol, smoke, and other flammable gases, making it a valuable component in ensuring safety and early detection of potential hazards in various indoor and industrial environments. Its simplicity, low cost, and efficiency have made it a popular choice for gas detection applications.

	\begin{justify}
		
		In the above block diagram, on the left side, various components such as sensors, switches, and a buzzer are present. The data from these sensors is sent  to the microcontroller ESP32. Upon receiving this data, the ESP32 facilitates relay, swtich, fan, buzzer, etc equipment according to logic used. The ESP32 continuously sends data to the  cloud, and this data can be monitored in the Blynk app. Using the Blynk cloud, we can control switches and devices like fans, enabling remote control functionality through ESP32.
	\end{justify}
	\begin{justify}
		
		Starting with sensors, we have use four main sensors; MQ2 sensor, PIR, RFID and Water level sensor.
		
	\end{justify}
	\begin{justify}
		
		
		The MQ2 gas sensor typically operates at a working voltage of 5V. This  gas sensing module capable of detecting various flammable and explosive gases, such as methane (CH4), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), and smoke in the air. It provides an analog output. The output value ranges from 0 -4095 values. WHen value from MQ2 sensor is read, it is send to the IoT platform. If the threshold value exceed  then  it indicates the presence of harmful gases. The exit fan is turned on  and Buzzer is turned on. Data from MQ2 sensor can be monitored from IoT platform.
	\end{justify}
	\begin{justify}
		The Water level sensor typically operates at a working voltage of 5V. It also  provides an analog output. Its working temperature is : 10℃~30℃.  This item can judge the water level through with a series of exposed parallel wires stitch to measure the water droplet/water size.  We use water level sensor for  Tank Water Management. Initially we set water pump motor off. Then we take data from level sensor. We send data to the IoT platform too. If the value is less than minimum threshold, we turn motor on and pump water and when the water level reach maximum of we turn off the motor and again constantly  read value from level sensor. 
	\end{justify}
	\begin{justify}
		
		PIR sensor operate in DC 4.5-20V. It provides digital output. We use PIR sensor with LDR sensor to work PIR only on night time. We read the value from LDR. If value is greater than  threshold, it indicate the night time. So we turn on PIR sensor and read value from PIR. If motion is detected then the blub glow in the room. We set delay time to turn off PIR and we again read value from PIR. if no any motion is detected we turn off PIR and take value from LDR. We can also turn on and off light through IoT platform.
	
	\end{justify}
	\begin{justify}
		
		RFID a technology that uses wireless communication to identify, track, and manage objects, people, or animals. RFID systems consist of tags (or transponders) and readers (or interrogators). The tags contain information that can be read by the readers using radio frequency signals. RFID sensor is use for door automation in our project. If the tag matches the RFID reader the door gets open. If the tag doesn't match the door won't get opened.

	\section{Limitations}
	\begin{justify}
		

	Since the device is designed as a prototype and made using the simple electronic components, there are some limitations that are listed below:\\
	1. This project home automation does not operate during power interruptions and totally rely on availablity of electricity.\\
	2.  The reliability of our project heavily depends on a stable and robust internet connection. Network outages or disruptions affect the functionality of IoT devices.\\
	3. Since,  water level sensor is  of prototyping standard, it lacks the flexibility to adapt to various shapes and sizes of water tanks commonly installed in homes.\\
	4. Though it is a fully automatic system, it cannot be controlled using manual switches. \\

	\section{Conclusion}
	
	\begin{justify}
		

   
    
    	With the help of ESP32 and  IoT concept, home automation has been acheived. The data from  sensor is sent to micro controller ESP32. On receiving data, the ESP32 facilitates relay to control switches and fan, buzzer according to the logic used. ESP32 also continuously send data to the cloud and  home appliances can be controlled and monitor through IoT platform. \\
    Five different sensors are used to control home automation; MQ2 sensor, RFID, PIR, LDR and water level sensor.\\
    MQ2 sensor is used for Kitchen Fire Protection. When harmful gases is detected, ESP32 sends signal to turn on exit fan, turn off regulator using servo motor and turn on emergency beep and cut off power supply of kitchen room. Amount of gases can be constantly monitored from IOT cloud platform.\\
    Water sensor is used for Tank Water Management. Water level sensor senses the level of water in tank. When tank is around full, water is not pumped into tank and when water level of tank falls down, water is automatically pumped into tank without spillage of water by sending signal from ESP32. Relay module is used to drive water pump motor. Level of water in tank can also be monitored from IoT platform and also can control water pump motor using IoT platform.\\
    PIR along with LDR  is used for Light Control.  We use PIR sensor with LDR sensor to work PIR only on night time. The value of PIR is send to ESP32 and ESP32 sends control signal to turn off or on room light. Light of each room can also be controlled from IoT platform.\\ 
    RFID sensor is use for door automation. It is also connected to ESP32. If the tag matches the RFID reader the door gets open. If the tag doesn't matches the door won't get opened. Door lock can also be controlled from IoT platform.

	\section{Future Enhancement}
		\begin{justify}
Due to various factors like limited time, failure of devices, we are not able to give our full attention to all the sectors of project and concerned only towards our main objectives. When considering ways to enhance and make our home project more smart in future, there are numerous  possibilities for additions:\\
		1. Power Backup Solutions: Implement a  power backup system, to ensure uninterrupted functionality during power outages.\\
		2. Smart Perimeter Security: Integrate smart sensors along the fence and home boundary to detect unauthorized entry attempts.\\
		3.Versatile Water Level Sensor Design: Develop an adaptable water level sensor that can accommodate large water tanks commonly installed in homes.
