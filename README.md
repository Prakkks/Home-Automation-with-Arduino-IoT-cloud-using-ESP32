# Home-Automation-with-Arduino-IoT-cloud-using-ESP32
This home automation project was undertaken and presented as a minor project in 2024 by our team. In this project, we utilized the ESP32 as a microcontroller. The system enables the manual control and monitoring of home appliances via Wi-Fi, and it also has the capability to function automatically.
