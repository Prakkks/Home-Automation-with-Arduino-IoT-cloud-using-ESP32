# Home-Automation-with-Arduino-IoT-cloud-using-ESP32
This home automation project was undertaken and presented as a minor project in 2024 by our team. In this project, we use the ESP32 as a microcontroller. The system enables the manual control and monitoring of home appliances via Wi-Fi, and it also has the capability to function automatically. The primary focus of this project is on both security and comfort convenience, addressing four key aspects.

Firstly, for enhanced security, a door lock with an RFID system has been implemented. This RFID system allows only authorized individuals with the appropriate tag to access the home. Otherwise, a buzzer is activated.

Additionally, the project includes a water tank management system. This system monitors water levels in the tank, preventing water spillage and automatically managing water usage. It ensures that the tank is filled when empty and stops the motor when it's full.

In the third aspect, we have considered kitchen fire protection. In the event of an LPG gas leak, the system cuts off power to the kitchen, shuts down the regulator, activates a buzzer alarm, and turns on the exit fan to expel the gas outdoors. The owner can also constantly monitor system through app or web interface.

Finally, an automatic lighting system has been implemented. This system detects ambient light levels and presence, turning on the lights during night or darkness conditions. If no one is detected, the lights are automatically turned off, promoting energy efficiency. All these functions can be controlled and monitored remotely via Wi-Fi through both a mobile application and a web interface.
